        html: `When you speak your worries aloud, it's easier to see your panicked scenario as unlikely. Consider a boy waiting for a girl to respond to his prom invitation. His brain churns: She's giggling right now with her friends, who are going to ostracize him. Oh no. He'll have no friends. He'll never get married. "It carries emotion far beyond reality, but if you can speak it to yourself or a trusted friend, you quickly realize that's not the way it's going to be," says Joe Newman of Life Launch Centers.`

Arczynski of the University of Utah Campus Counseling Center. Instead, acknowledge the feeling, either "swipe" it away or unpack it — no judgment for feeling how you feel.`

        html: `Identifying a stressful emotion can decrease its intensity by nearly half. Ask a child having an outburst to name what he's feeling — "Anger" "Sadness" "Fear" — and assign an intensity number, 1-10. It not only short-circuits the emotion, but forces the brain to think logically, shifting brain activity to the executive function, which imaging suggests goes dark when the amygdala is lit by emotion and anxiety.`
