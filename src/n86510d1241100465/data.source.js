I felt very clearly that the Lord had told me to go back to knock on the door of that home. It was immediately clear that the family was living in extreme poverty, but what really stood out to me was how humble they were. They believed in the restored gospel and had a desire to follow Christ. They had two teenage girls that chose to be baptized first, followed by their parents a couple weeks later. 20 years later, the younger daughter, Ilsen, is a counselor in her stake Young Women's presidency, is married to a returned missionary, and has a young family of her own. When we found each other, we wept as we remembered the love we shared when I was their missionary. I have no doubt that the Lord whispered to me to knock on their door and that he already knew the full potential of that little 13 year old girl. The Lord knows our worth and potential, even if it isn't obvious to the world."<br /><br />— Davis Smith`

Then, at the fireside, my convert Jorge Apaza showed up. I motioned for him to sit by me. I was ecstatic. He was this 15 year old kid when we taught him and I didn't know if he would make it in the church. I didn't know how he was ever going to stay active because he didn't have the support of his family. Somehow he did it. He also served a mission in Colombia and here he was, 20 years later, sitting next to me. It was a joy that was unlike anything I've felt. It was so full and overflowing."<br /><br />— Kaerlig Hurtado`

In Sipe Sipe I prayed morning and night that it would go away, I prayed constantly that my homesickness would go away. I couldn't eat, I struggled to find confidence, and I almost lost hope. Then one day it was as if God said, ‘Scott you've carried this trial long enough, it's over.' Since that distinct day I've been free of homesickness. Faith, prayer, and perseverance are real! I remember entering that same humble adobe house with the same old wooden door every day for 6 months to eat lunch with my companion. The Quintanilla family took me as I was. They knew my Spanish was horrible, that I was struggling, and that I just wanted to help their people. I owe them a lot for their patience, their Christlike love, and their humility. They helped me get through one of the hardest times of my life."<br /><br />— Scott Mortensen`

While in the temple clothing line, I realized that I did have a sister with me, Jimena Herrera, from Oruru Bolivia. Jimena passed away a few years ago, yet she wanted me to know that she was there with me. I felt impressed to share my feelings with other return missionaries in the line.

She said under her breath to her daughter that she didn't want to ‘tell the Elder the truth,' which I overheard. I told her that she could definitely tell me the truth. She confided that she hadn't been to Church for awhile and had not yet been to the temple.  Her husband travels a lot for his job and so she sits alone at Church, which she doesn't like. I invited her to go back to Church. I talked with her husband by phone that night as well. The next day, we met her at the Church for sacrament meeting and she came and met the bishop. Before I left from the Church, she told me that she and her husband would work toward going to the temple and she committed me to go back down for their sealing, which my wife has heartily endorsed."<br /><br />— Peter Wirthlin`

Over several months, her heart softened and she decided to be baptized. Unfortunately, as the years went by, Giovanna ended up marrying a non-member and stopped attending church. Every time I returned to Bolivia I would visit her and remind her of her baptism and her conversion. After years of effort and prayers on her behalf, she returned to activity in the church. She now serves in her ward's Primary presidency, and her husband has been listening to the discussions for the last four years. He doesn't feel quite ready to be baptized, but during my visit a few weeks ago he bore a simple testimony of the gospel, and I bore mine. We can never give up on people who have distanced themselves from the church."<br /><br />— Davis Smith`

I had served in Tarija around the same time but in another ward. For many years I have tried to find Isabella, a young women who was a new member in the ward I served in. She was our ward missionary and was, in my opinion, the celestial example of a ward missionary. Even though I have looked and looked on Facebook and have asked others, no one knew where she was. At the ward we visited, Karee and I were asked to share our testimonies and introduce ourselves. Immediately after the meeting this wonderful woman came up to me and challenged me to guess who she was. I could recognize her face, but I couldn't come up with a name. When she told me that she was Isabella I cried like a baby as I hugged her. She shared that she served a full time mission and married in the temple. I believe I got a glimpse of how our Father in Heaven feels when we return home. This was a tender mercy and an answer to a prayer for me." <br /><br />— Broderick Pack`

The answer included an invitation to be baptized. The rest is history. Her husband was also baptized and later sealed to Adela.

And, thanks to the kindness of friends and members in the area, we were able to find the Antesanas, 21 years later. I was joyful to discover that, not only was he baptized 18 years ago, but that Brother Antesana had served in various capacities, including six years on the high council. What a joy it was to meet their children, some who have served missions, and to see beautiful grandchildren who were being raised in the Church. We learned that, prior to the dedication of the Cochabamba Temple, Bishop Ibanez promised Brother Antesana that he would work with him to help him qualify for a temple recommend. That promise helped him develop the strength to overcome addiction, and to experience greater joy in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ."<br /><br />— David McConkie`
