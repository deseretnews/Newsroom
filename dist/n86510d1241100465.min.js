Jimena passed away a few years ago, yet she wanted me to know that she was there with me. I felt impressed to share my feelings with other return missionaries in the line. Imagine our joy when we discovered that we had a friend in common — these sisters were visiting from Jimena's ward.  It's these small experiences that bring peace and joy to the soul.\"<br /><br />— Christen Knickerbocker"},{image:null,title:null,caption:null,html:"\"I went to find one of my convert families from Tupiza. I found out that they moved to Cochabamba and was in touch with one of the sons.  When we visited I asked the mom what her calling was in the Church. She said under her breath to her daughter that she didn't want to ‘tell the Elder the truth,' which I overheard. I told her that she could definitely tell me the truth. She confided that she hadn't been to Church for awhile and had not yet been to the temple.  Her husband travels a lot for his job and so she sits alone at Church, which she doesn't like. I invited her to go back to Church. I talked with her husband by phone that night as well. The next day, we met her at the Church for sacrament meeting and she came and met the bishop. Before I left from the Church, she told me that she and her husband would work toward going to the temple and she committed me to go back down for their sealing, which my wife has heartily endorsed.\"<br /><br />— Peter Wirthlin"},{image:"https://media.deseretdigital.com/file/559a651847?resize=width_500&type=image/jpeg&c=6&a=d04ae381",title:null,caption:"Peter Wirthlin and his wife, left, with a woman he converted some 20 years ago in Tupiza, Bolivia and one of her sons outside of the Petrolero Ward in Cochabamba.",html:null},{image:null,title:null,caption:null,html:"\"Half way through my mission, my companion and I taught and baptized a brother and sister. Mauricio had an incredible amount of faith, but his sister Giovanna had a lot more questions. Over several months, her heart softened and she decided to be baptized. Unfortunately, as the years went by, Giovanna ended up marrying a non-member and stopped attending church. Every time I returned to Bolivia I would visit her and remind her of her baptism and her conversion. After years of effort and prayers on her behalf, she returned to activity in the church. She now serves in her ward's Primary presidency, and her husband has been listening to the discussions for the last four years. He doesn't feel quite ready to be baptized, but during my visit a few weeks ago he bore a simple testimony of the gospel, and I bore mine. We can never give up on people who have distanced themselves from the church.\"<br /><br />— Davis Smith"},{image:"https://media.deseretdigital.com/file/59c4d73561?resize=width_500&type=image/jpeg&c=6&a=d04ae381",title:null,caption:"Davis Smith with two members he taught during his time near Cochabamba 20 years ago.

I had served in Tarija around the same time but in another ward. For many years I have tried to find Isabella, a young women who was a new member in the ward I served in. She was our ward missionary and was, in my opinion, the celestial example of a ward missionary. Even though I have looked and looked on Facebook and have asked others, no one knew where she was. At the ward we visited, Karee and I were asked to share our testimonies and introduce ourselves. Immediately after the meeting this wonderful woman came up to me and challenged me to guess who she was. I could recognize her face, but I couldn\'t come up with a name. When she told me that she was Isabella I cried like a baby as I hugged her. She shared that she served a full time mission and married in the temple. I believe I got a glimpse of how our Father in Heaven feels when we return home. This was a tender mercy and an answer to a prayer for me." <br /><br />— Broderick Pack'},{image:null,title:null,caption:null,html:'"Johnny Rojas Choque, who is now a stake president in Cochabamba, was so hospitable. He helped us find the Urquieta family, whose conversion to the truth of the Book of Mormon has inspired us, all these many years later. We remember well that when Adela Urquieta felt the Lord confirm to her the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon, her natural reaction was to ask, ‘What should I do?\' The answer included an invitation to be baptized. The rest is history. Her husband was also baptized and later sealed to Adela. We were so impressed with their returned missionary grandson and other faithful members of the Urquieta family."<br /><br />— David McConkie'},{image:"https://media.deseretdigital.com/file/be05b63001?resize=width_500&type=image/jpeg&c=6&a=d04ae381",title:null,caption:"From left to right: Johnny Choque, Adela Urquieta, David McConkie, and Kevin Burke.

Most of us never saw the temple dedicated and completed when we were missionaries. For me, the ward/area of the temple was one of my areas. Elder Ayala and I would walk by the temple under construction everyday but were never able to see it completed. To be able to go through the temple as a group of missionaries that had served there 20 years ago was very emotional. ...

And, thanks to the kindness of friends and members in the area, we were able to find the Antesanas, 21 years later. I was joyful to discover that, not only was he baptized 18 years ago, but that Brother Antesana had served in various capacities, including six years on the high council. What a joy it was to meet their children, some who have served missions, and to see beautiful grandchildren who were being raised in the Church. We learned that, prior to the dedication of the Cochabamba Temple, Bishop Ibanez promised Brother Antesana that he would work with him to help him qualify for a temple recommend. That promise helped him develop the strength to overcome addiction, and to experience greater joy in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ."<br /><br />— David McConkie'},{image:null,title:null,caption:null,html:'"I stood with my friend Gonzalo under the same palm tree at the same church where we baptized him nearly 20 years ago.

Three of her siblings are currently serving missions as well. But, what makes this story particularly interesting is that the missionaries were pulled from the area and the branch was closed (shortly after I left). The members didn\'t have a place to attend Church and many in the area went inactive with no Church to attend nearby. But somehow a 14 year old girl stayed faithful and held onto her testimony."<br /><br />— Sean Alibrando'}]}}]);
